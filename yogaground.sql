He was diagnosed with intestinal  cancer in 1951, a discovery which led him to re-evaluate his yoga and spiritual  practice. He set up a teaching dojo<strong><a href="#dojo" style="text-decoration:none">*</a> </strong>in Mishima in 1967. Some  of his pupils went to Europe to start teaching Okido yoga. One such student was Tomoko Mori, and her  husband  Hirotsugu  Mori who came to the UK in 1984. Tomoko has been teaching Okido  yoga in weekly classes and leading retreats since she arrived in the UK.</p>\r\n  <p> The current head of Okido yoga in Europe is Mizue Tamaki. As well as teaching she has translated B.K.S. Iyengar’s  “Light on Yoga” and “Light on Pranayama” into Japanese.</p>\r\n  <p>Okido yoga  practitioners are expected to build their own practice by lifelong personal  research into their daily life and experience rather than relying on external  forms or teachings. Breathing, gratitude for all of life, building hara power,  tuning into the life force, humbleness and learning through personal experience  are all important concepts in the Okido method. Mizue Tamaki says in her booklet ‘Philosophical  Background of Oki Yoga Dojo Holland’ <br />\r\n      <em>“There  is no fixed form called ‘yoga’. To do what is most suitable and necessary at  any moment, this is yoga”.</em> Tomoko Mori says<em> &quot;[Oki yoga] also emphasizes  the importance of learning to work with, and for, others as it is not  possible  to create a balanced life that does not include harmonious and caring  interaction within society.&quot; </em></p>\r\n  <p>Oki yoga  teachers prepare or improvise a class according to the condition of the participants  and time of year. A class might consist of many different practices and there  is a wide variation between teachers in their approaches and areas of special  expertise.  The emphasis on internal  principles rather than external form makes it hard to define the practices in a  class or retreat. Classes or retreats might (or might not) have some of the  following:<br />\r\n      <strong>Asanas</strong> – these are asanas familiar to  students of Hatha yoga. Generally, a lot of emphasis is placed on preparation  and coming out of the posture as well as the asana itself.<br />\r\n      <strong>Purification  exercises</strong> –  Most of the  exercises are repeated stretches designed to activate particular meridians.<br />\r\n      <strong>Corrective  exercises</strong> – to  correct distortions or weaknesses in one side of the body or the other through  asymmetrical movement with a special focus on the weaker side.<br />\r\n      <strong>Kyoka-Ho</strong> – a series of very energetic  strengthening exercises intended to build strength, stamina and hara power. <br />\r\n      <strong>Partner  exercises</strong> – a  series of stretches done with a partner, the purpose of which is support each  other and deepen the stretch.<br />\r\n      <strong>Meditation  and chanting</strong> –  meditation is sometimes done at the end of classes. Chanting of a heart sutra  in Chinese is usually carried out on retreats. <br />\r\n      <strong>Affirmations  – </strong>there are a  series of affirmations done before events like meals, cleaning, sleep etc on  retreats.</p>\r\n  <p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\r\n  <p>There is a  dojo in Laren, Holland which offers retreats, courses and a four year  teacher training course.

(7, 'alexander_tech', 'The Alexander Technique', '<p>This is a school of body work founded by F. Matthias Alexander (20 January 1869 – 10 October 1955), an Australian actor. He devised the technique during the period 1890 to 1900 was a way to cure himself of difficulties with his voice. He observed that when he thought about delivering a speech, his neck contracted and more the he tried to do something about it, the worse it became. It was only when he learned the technique of ''inhibition'' and giving directions that his voice returned. He came to London in 1904 and established a practice there. He started a teacher training school in London in 1930. </p>\r\n  <p> The Alexander technique has some key principles:<br />\r\n      <strong>Inhibition</strong> – in common usage, this term usually means ''repression''. In the Alexander technique inhibition means observing the start of a habitual pattern of movement. For example, when I''m asked to do an asana like trikonasana (triangle pose), I can sometime observe that I have a ''get ready'' pose which often stops me from flowing naturally into the pose. If I''m able to inhibit this reaction in the Alexander sense, I''m able to stop myself going into the pose on automatic pilot. In yoga, we talk of samskaras, which roughly translate as habits or grooves in the mind. <br />\r\n    <strong>Directions</strong> –  Directions are repeated affirmations about releasing the neck, head and back. In yoga they might be thought of as instructions to the subtle or unseen body.</p>\r\n  <p>The Alexander technique is a meta technique, that is, it is often learned by people who want to improve their ability to perform tasks. It is popular with actors and musicians, particularly classical musicians. <br />\r\n    <strong>Resources</strong></p>\r\n  <p>STAT is the main body governing the Alexander technique.
